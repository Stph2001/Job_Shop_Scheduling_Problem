# Instructions

* Complete the assignment using any programming language.
* You need to send the source code of your solution along
  with a markdown containing graphs of the progress of the
  solutions after running for exactly 3 minutes.
* All your files should go in a github (or similar)
  repository.
* You must send the link to the repository online and a zip
  containing all the files as well.

## Part 1

For the problem discussed in class, JSSP, organize the python code (in a different language if you prefer) to test the random sampling solutions discussed in class.

* (3 points) make the code reusable streamlined to test different instances of the problem.

* (2 points) run the random sampling method on the same 
instances seen in CC206-Sesion6.pdf for exactly 3 minutes.

* (2 points) present graphs of the results in a similar fashion as seen in CC206-Sesion6.pdf.

## Part 2

Implement a solution using simulated annealing or genetic
algorithm.

* (5 points) implement the solution using 1 of the algorithms.

* (3 points) run for 3 minutes on the same instances as seen in CC206-Sesion6.pdf

* (2 points) present graphs of the results in a similar fashion as seen in CC206-Sesion6.pdf.

* (3 points) present your conclusions of the results obtained.
